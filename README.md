# iDM-low-pt-ele-analysis-results
A summary of results for investigating the potentials of using the BParking electron reconstruction algorithm in the search for iDM with MET and low pt electrons (CADI line EXO-020-010). Using xbgoost to come up with a unique id is also being investigated. The currect xgboost file contains a manually fitted model. Optimal parameters could be found using GridSearchCV.
